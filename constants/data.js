      `I've been developing full-stack applications since I was about 15 years old, in Java. I didn't know what I was really doing back then, still don't think I do. I've mostly being working in Infrastructure, so I write a lot of Infrastructure as Code now (IAC).`,
      `I really enjoy web-development, even though it's the bane of my life since it's relatively complex to pick up - you need to know a lot of languages to be successful. Thank God for Bootstrap!`,
      `I've been coding in React, Java, Python, a-little bit of Ruby and Go-lang, Typescript, MySQL, Bootstrap, and Assembly - just kidding! - to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!),`,
